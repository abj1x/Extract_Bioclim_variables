#  Extracting bioclimatic variables and elevations based on spatially projected lat long coordinated for Arabidopsis 1001 genome accessions

## Description
can be used to extract a range of BioClim abiotic variables for geographic locations of e.g. Arabidopsis ecotypes

Used to obtain bioclimatic data for the ecotype locations used in James et al. 2018 Plant Cell & Environ 41(7): 1524-1538) 'Global spatial analysis of Arabidopsis natural variants implicates 5'UTR splicing of LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL in responses to temperature.'
